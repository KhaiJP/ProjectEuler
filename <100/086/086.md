## Problem Settings
Since the rotations are ignored, we can write the side lengths as
* $a, b, c$ and $a \le b \le c$  

without loss of generality.
In this setting, the square of the shortest path is $\eta^2 + c^2 $, where $\eta = a + b$. Hence the probelm is now as following;
1. find $M$ such that ${\rm sum}([\,\#\{\eta_c\}\, |\, c \in [1..M]\,]) $
1. find number of $\eta_c$ for given $c$ such that; $ \, \eta_c^2+c^2 \, {\rm is \, squared} \, \land 2 \le \eta_c \le 2c $


## How to Solve
The first part is efficiently solved by calculating the prefix sum.  
The second part is done by $O(c)$, scaning from $1$ to $2c$ as $\eta = a + b \le 2c$. For each $\eta$,  
1. when $2 \le \eta \le c+1$, then
   $$ (a, b) = (1, \eta-1), (2, \eta-2), \cdots , (\lfloor\eta/2\rfloor, \lceil\eta/2\rceil) $$
   are answers. Hence $\lfloor\eta / 2\rfloor$ is the $\#\{\eta\}$.
1. when $ c+1 \lt \eta \le 2c $, then
   $$ (a, b) = (d, \eta-d), (d+1, \eta-d-1), \cdots , (\lfloor\eta/2\rfloor, \lceil\eta/2\rceil) $$
   are answers, where $d = \eta - c$. Note that $(a, b) = (1, \eta-1)$ is not an answer as $b = \eta - 1 \gt c$ contradicts $b \lt c$.
   Hence $\lfloor\eta/2\rfloor - (d - 1)$ is the $\#\{\eta\}$.
