## General Terms
First let us consider the sequence that runs to upper right direction; $` 1, 9, 25, \cdots \, `$.  
The general term of this sequence seems $` a_n = (2n+1)^2 `$ where $`n`$ is the distance from the centre starting with $`0`$. This is actually true as following;  

1. the square of distance $`k`$ has edge of length $` 2k+1 `$
1. each square has contains $` (2k+1)^2 `$ numbers
1. the upper-right-most value is biggest.  

By using this sequence, the general terms of the 3 other sequencies can be calculated;  

* upper-left : $` b_n =  a_n - \{(2n+1) - 1\} = 4n^2+2n+1 `$
* lower-left : $` c_n = b_n - \{(2n+1)-1\} = 4n^2+1 `$
* lower-right : $` d_n = c_n - \{(2n+1)-1\} = 4n^2-2n+1 `$

## Distance to the square of edge length $1001$ 
Next, we are to find the distance $d$ to the square of edge length $` 1001 `$.  
This d can be found by solving the equation below;
$$` 2d+1 = 1001 `$$
Hence $` d = 500 `$.

## Answer
The answer $s$ can be evaluated by calculating the summations of the sequencies;
$$\begin{align*}
s &= \sum_{n=1}^{d}a_n + \sum_{n=1}^{d}b_n + \sum_{n=1}^{d}c_n + \sum_{n=1}^{d}d_n + 1  \nonumber\\
&= 16\sum_{n=1}^{d}n^2 + 4\sum_{n=1}^{d}n + 4\sum_{n=1}^{d} + 1 \nonumber \\
&= \biggl\{\frac{16n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}+\frac{4n(n+1)}{2} + 4n\biggr\}\biggr|_{n=500} + 1 \nonumber \\
&=  669171001\nonumber
\end{align*}$$
here the $` +1 `$ of the first row corresponds the $` 1 `$ of the centre.
