### $n$ is not multiple of $p$
By factoring the fomula, we obtain
```math
    {\large
        n^2(n + p).
    }
```
If $n$ is mutiple of $p$, say $ n = kp$, the fomula above is
```math
    {\large
        k^2(k+1)p^3.
    }
```
where $k^2(k+1)$ is not cubed, and hence the whole fomula is not cubed.
( $k^3 < k^2(k+1) < (k+1)^3 $)

Hence $n$ is not a multipe of $p$.


### $n$ and $n+p$ are bothe cubed
Since $n$ is not multiple of $p$, $n$ and $n+p$ are coprime, $i.e.$ $n^2$ and $n+p$ are coprime. To make the whole $n^2(n+p)$ be cubed, $n$ and $n+p$ are both cubed.


### $n$ and $n+p$ are neighbour cubed numbers
Say $n = l^3$ and $n+p = (l+k)^3$, then the gap $p$ is
```math
    {\large
        \begin{align}
            p &= (n+p) - (n) \nonumber \\
              &= (l+k)^3 - l^3 \nonumber \\
              &= 3l^2k + 3lk^2 + k^3 \nonumber \\
              &= k\times(3l^2 + 3lk + k^2) \nonumber.
        \end{align}
    }
```
Since $p$ is required to be prime, $k$ must be $1$, $i.e.$ $n$ and $n+p$ are neighbour cubed numbers.


### $l$ is less than $600$
Since $p$ is required to be less than $10^6$, $3l^2 + 3l + 1 < 10^6$ must be satisfied, and $3 \times 600^2 = 1.08 \times 10^6 > 10^6$, $l$ is less than $600$.
(more precisely $577$ is the first number that makes the gap exceed $10^6$)
